# Churn-Risk-Analysis

Project Overview:
A customer base had been significantly declining without having a clear approach to identifying causes of churn as well as which customer segments have rates of increased risk. There was no strategy for analyzing historical data and segmenting customer behaviors both proactively and reactively. This project was set to identify which impactful factors utilizing data garnered from the returns to lose customers, which in turn would create actionable recommendations to increase customer stickiness and reduce churn rates.


Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel):
Cleaned and standardized records in the raw customer data to ensure data consistency across variables. 
Management of missing values, conversion of non-numeric fields into usable analyzable fields, removal of unneeded fields.
Identified patterns of data anomalies; ultimately created a cleaned data set that was structured to provide thorough analysis.

Analytical Goals:
Identify customer segments with the highest churn structures (by length of tenure, contract-type, and service usage)
Examine payment structures, internet usage, and any support-related communication with customers.
Segment customers using demographic information (i.e. senior citizens) to see which segments were most vulnerable to churn.
Provide a basis for targeting retention strategies based upon action items discovered.
